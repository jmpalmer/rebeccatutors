      <h3> My name is Rebecca Baldwin, and I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in Science Education and a Minor in Math Education. After graduating, I taught both math and science at Middle and High School levels at private schools in Tampa and Jacksonville for six years. </h3><h3>I began private tutoring in 2009 and soon made it my full time job. Currently I am serving as an active participant in the Clay County Take Stock in Children program as a mentor. In addition, I am pursuing continuing education to keep updated on developments in the fields of math and science.</h3>
